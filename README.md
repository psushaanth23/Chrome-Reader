# Chrome-Reader
An Extension that reads out the selected text on a webpage.

Rather than using an online text to speech converter like google's gTTS or meSpeak the default operating system's text to speech converter is used. Therefore it also works offline.

Usage : Right click on the selected text, and select speak this text.
